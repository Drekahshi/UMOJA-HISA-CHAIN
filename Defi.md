# Umoja DeFi Protocol

## Executive Summary

The Umoja DeFi Protocol is an AI-enhanced decentralized finance ecosystem built on Hedera Hashgraph, specifically designed to bridge traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) for emerging markets. The protocol integrates Real-World Asset (RWA) tokenization, intelligent automated market making, and sophisticated risk management to create a comprehensive financial infrastructure.

## Protocol Architecture

### Core Infrastructure

- **Protocol Engine**: Smart contract infrastructure handling asset tokenization, AMM operations, lending/borrowing, and yield optimization
- **AI/DAO Governance Layer**: Autonomous decision-making framework with risk assessment and liquidity optimization algorithms

### Triple-Token Economic Model
